<h1 id="Pod"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top document">Pod</a></h1><p>
<dfn id="_defn_Pod">Pod</dfn> is an easy-to-use markup language with a simple, consistent underlying document object model. Pod can be used for writing language documentation, for documenting programs and modules, as well as for other types of document composition.</p>
<p>Pod is an evolution of Perl 5's <a href="doc:perlpod"><em>Plain Ol&#39; Documentation</em></a> (POD) markup. Compared to POD, Perl 6's Pod is much more uniform, somewhat more compact, and considerably more expressive. The Pod dialect also differs in that it is a purely descriptive mark-up notation, with no presentational components.</p>
<h2 id="General_syntactic_structure"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top document">General syntactic structure</a></h2><p>Pod documents are specified using 
<dfn id="_defn_directives">directives</dfn>, which are used to declare configuration information and to delimit blocks of textual content. All Pod directives are considered to be special types of comments in Perl 6.</p>
<p>Every directive starts either with an equals sign (<code>=</code>) followed immediately by an identifier , or with a <code>#=</code> or <code>#|</code> followed immediately by whitespace or an opening bracket.</p>
<p>Directives that start with <code>=</code> can be indented like the code they interleave, but their initial <code>=</code> must still be the first non-whitespace character on their line. Directives that start with <code>#=</code> or <code>#|</code> can be placed anywhere that a Perl 6 comment can appear, though they are meaningful only in a subset of those places; see <a href="#Declarator_blocks">#Declarator blocks</a>.</p>
<p>An indented Pod block is considered to have a <em>virtual left margin</em>, determined by the indentation of its opening delimiter.</p>
<p>In other words, if a directive is indented from the left margin, the column at which the first character of its opening delimiter appears is thereafter considered the first column of the entire block's contents.</p>
<p>As with Perl 6 heredocs, the virtual margin treats leading tabs as aligning to tabstops spaced every <code>($?TABSTOP // 8)</code> characters.</p>
<h2 id="Pod_blocks"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top document">Pod blocks</a></h2><p>The content of a document is specified within one or more 
<dfn id="_defn_blocks">blocks</dfn>. Every Pod block may be declared in any of four forms:</p>
<p><a href="#Delimited_blocks"><em>delimited style</em></a>, <a href="#Paragraph_blocks"><em>paragraph style</em></a>, <a href="#Abbreviated_blocks"><em>abbreviated style</em></a>, or <a href="#Declarator_blocks"><em>declarator style</em></a>. The first three forms are all equivalent; the fourth is distinct.</p>
<p>Anything in a document that is neither a Pod directive nor contained within a Pod block is treated as "ambient" material. Typically this would be the source code of the program that the Pod is documenting. Pod parsers still parse this text into the internal representation of the file, representing it as a <code>Pod::Block::Ambient</code> block. Renderers will <em>usually</em> ignore such blocks, but see <a href="#Aliases">#Aliases</a>.</p>
<p>In Perl 5's POD format, once a POD directive is encountered, the parser considers everything that follows to be POD, until an explicit <code>=cut</code> directive is encountered, at which point the parser flips back to parsing ambient source code. The Perl 6 Pod format is different. All Pod directives have a defined terminator and the Pod parser always reverts to "ambient" at the end of each Pod directive or block. To cause the parser to remain in Pod mode, you must enclose the desired Pod region in a <code>pod</code> block:</p>
<pre>    <strong>=begin pod</strong>

    =head1 A heading

    This is Pod too. Specifically, this is a simple C&lt;para&gt; block

        $this = pod(&#39;also&#39;);  # Specifically, a code block

    <strong>=end pod</strong>
</pre><h3 id="Delimited_blocks"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top document">Delimited blocks</a></h3><p>Delimited blocks are bounded by <code>=begin</code> and <code>=end</code> markers, both of which are followed by a valid Perl 6 identifier, which is the 
<dfn id="_defn_typename">typename</dfn> of the block. Typenames that are entirely lowercase (for example: <code>=begin head1</code>) or entirely uppercase (for example: <code>=begin SYNOPSIS</code>) are reserved.</p>
<p>After the typename, the rest of the <code>=begin</code> marker line is treated as configuration information for the block. This information is used in different ways by different types of blocks, but is always specified using Perl6-ish option pairs. That is, any of:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Value is...</th>
<th>Specify with...</th>
<th>Or with...</th>
<th>Or with...</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Boolean (true)</td>
<td>C«:key»</td>
<td>C«:key(1)»</td>
<td>C«key => 1»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Boolean (false)</td>
<td>C«:!key»</td>
<td>C«:key(0)»</td>
<td>C«key => 0»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>String</td>
<td>C«:key<str>»</td>
<td>C«:key('str')»</td>
<td>C«key => 'str'»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>List</td>
<td>C«:key<1 2 3>»</td>
<td>C«:key[1,2,3]»</td>
<td>C«key => [1,2,3]»</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hash</td>
<td>C«:key{a=>1, b=>2}»</td>
<td></td>
<td>C«key => {a=>1, b=>2}»</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All option keys and values must, of course, be constants since Pod is a specification language, not a programming language. Specifically, option values cannot be closures. See Synopsis 2 for details of the various Perl 6 pair notations.</p>
<p>The configuration section may be extended over subsequent lines by starting those lines with an <code>=</code> in the first (virtual) column followed by a whitespace character.</p>
<p>The lines following the opening delimiter and configuration are the data or contents of the block, which continue until the block's matching <code>=end</code> marker line. For most block types, these contents may be indented if you wish, without them being treated as <a href="#Code_blocks">code blocks</a>. Unlike Perl 5, indented text is only treated as code within <code>=pod</code>, <a href="#Nesting_blocks"><code>=nested</code></a>, <a href="#Lists"><code>=item</code></a>, <code>=code</code>, and <a href="#Semantic_blocks">semantic</a> blocks.</p>
<p>The general syntax is:</p>
<pre>     =begin <var>BLOCK_TYPE</var>  <var>OPTIONAL CONFIG INFO</var>
     =                  <var>OPTIONAL EXTRA CONFIG INFO</var>
     <var>BLOCK CONTENTS</var>
     =end <var>BLOCK_TYPE</var>
</pre><p>For example:</p>
<pre>     =begin table  :caption&lt;Table of Contents&gt;
         Constants           1

         Variables           10

         Subroutines         33

         Everything else     57
     =end table

        =begin Name  :required
        =            :width(50)
        The applicant&#39;s full name
        =end Name

        =begin Contact  :optional
            The applicant&#39;s contact details
        =end Contact
</pre><p>Note that no blank lines are required around the directives; blank lines within the contents are always treated as part of the contents. This is a universal feature of Pod.</p>
<p>Note also that in the following specifications, a "blank line" is a line that is either empty or that contains only whitespace characters. That is, a blank line matches the Perl 6 pattern: <code>/^^ \h* $$/</code>. Pod uses blank lines as delimiters, rather than empty lines, to minimize unpleasant surprises when stray spaces or tabs mysteriously turn up in hitherto empty lines.</p>
<h3 id="Paragraph_blocks"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top document">Paragraph blocks</a></h3><p>Paragraph blocks are introduced by a <code>=for</code> marker and terminated by the next Pod directive or the first blank line (which is <em>not</em> considered to be part of the block's contents). The <code>=for</code> marker is followed by the name of the block and optional configuration information. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre>     =for <var>BLOCK_TYPE</var>  <var>OPTIONAL CONFIG INFO</var>
     =                <var>OPTIONAL EXTRA CONFIG INFO</var>
     <var>BLOCK DATA</var>
</pre><p>For example:</p>
<pre>     =for table  :caption&lt;Table of Contents&gt;
         Constants           1
         Variables           10
         Subroutines         33
         Everything else     57

        =for Name  :required
        =          :width(50)
        The applicant&#39;s full name

     =for Contact  :optional
        The applicant&#39;s contact details

</pre><h3 id="Abbreviated_blocks"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top document">Abbreviated blocks</a></h3><p>Abbreviated blocks are introduced by an <code>&#39;=&#39;</code> sign in the first column, which is followed immediately by the typename of the block. The rest of the line is treated as block data, rather than as configuration. The content terminates at the next Pod directive or the first blank line (which is not part of the block data). The general syntax is:</p>
<pre>     =<var>BLOCK_TYPE</var>  <var>BLOCK DATA</var>
     <var>MORE BLOCK DATA</var>

</pre><p>For example:</p>
<pre>     =table
         Constants           1
         Variables           10
         Subroutines         33
         Everything else     57

        =Name  The applicant&#39;s full name
     =Contact  The applicant&#39;s contact details

</pre><p>Note that abbreviated blocks cannot specify configuration information. If configuration is required, use a <code>=for</code> or <code>=begin</code>/<code>=end</code> instead.</p>
<h3 id="Declarator_blocks"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top document">Declarator blocks</a></h3><p>The fourth form of Pod block differs from the first three in that it does not specify an explicit typename. Instead, it obtains its identity and purpose from the Perl 6 source code to which it is attached; specifically, from some nearby declarator.</p>
<p>Declarator blocks are introduced by a special Perl comment: either <code>#=</code> or <code>#|</code>, which must be immediately followed by either by a space or an opening bracket. If followed by a space, the block is terminated by the end of line; if followed by one or more opening brackets, the block is terminated by the matching sequence of closing brackets.</p>
<p>That is, declarator Pod blocks are syntactically like ordinary Perl 6 single-line comments and embedded comments. The general syntax is:</p>
<pre>     #| <var>BLOCK DATA TO END OF LINE</var>

     #|{ <var>BLOCK DATA</var>
         <var>MORE BLOCK DATA</var>
       }

     #= <var>BLOCK DATA TO END OF LINE</var>

     #={ <var>BLOCK DATA</var>
         <var>MORE BLOCK DATA</var>
       }

</pre><p>except that the bracketed forms may use <em>any</em> valid Perl 6 bracket delimiter (including repeated opening brackets), as described in Synopsis 2.</p>
<p>Declarator Pod blocks must either precede or immediately follow a valid Perl 6 declarator, and are then said to be "attached" to it. They are primarily intended to simplify the documentation of code interfaces.</p>
<p>Declarator blocks that start with <code>#|</code> attach to the declarator at the start of the line immediately after them (separated only by whitespace). Declarator blocks that start with <code>#=</code> attach to the declarator declared at the start of the line immediately before them. In all other respects they act just like comments (i.e. they are themselves whitespace as far as ambient source code is concerned). This means multiple declarator blocks can be specified in a row and will all attach to the same declarator.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>    #| Base class for comms necromancy hierarchy
    class Magic::Necrotelecomnicon {
        has $.elemental;  #= Source of all power
        has $!true_name;  #  Source of all self-protection (not documented)

        method cast(Spell $s)
        #= Initiate a specified spell normally
        #= (do not use for class 7 spells)
        {
            do_raw_magic($s);
        }


        method kast(  #= Initiate a specified spell abnormally
            Spell $s     #= The spell to be abnormally initiated
        ) {
            do_raw_magic($s, :alternative);
        }

        #| This subroutine does the real work
        sub do_raw_magic (
            Spell $s,         #= Which spell to invoke
            *%options         #= How to invoke it
        ) {...}
    }

    sub fu (Any $bar)
    #=[ This text stored in C&lt;&amp;fu.WHY&gt;, not in C&lt;$bar.WHY&gt;,
        (because C&lt;sub fu&gt; is the declarator
         at the I&lt;start&gt; of the preceding line)
      ]

    multi sub baz(Int $count, Str $name)
        #=[ This text stored in C&lt;&amp;baz:(Int,Str).WHY&gt;
            (i.e. the C&lt;.WHY&gt; of the variant, not of the entire multisub)
          ]
</pre><p>A declarator can have both a leading and a trailing Pod comment, in which case they are concatenated with an intermediate newline when their object's <code>.WHY</code> return value is stringified:</p>
<pre>#| This is a special chainsaw
my SwissArmy $chainsaw    #= (It has a rocket launcher)</pre><pre>say $chainsaw.WHY;    # prints: This is a special chainsaw
                      #         (It has a rocket launcher)</pre><p>The individual leading and trailing Pod comments can be retrieved via the returned Pod object's <code>.leading</code> and <code>.trailing</code> methods:</p>
<pre>say $chainsaw.WHY.leading;    # prints: This is a special chainsaw</pre><pre>say $chainsaw.WHY.trailing;   # prints: (It has a rocket launcher)</pre><p>The Pod object representing each Declarator block is still appended to the current surrounding Pod object (e.g. to <code>$=pod</code> at the top level). Each such block representation is an object of class <code>Pod::Block::Declarator</code>, and has a <code>.WHEREFORE</code> method that returns the code object or metaobject created by the declarator to which the documentation is attached.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>.WHY</code> and <code>.WHEREFORE</code> are inverse operations:</p>
<pre>                            .WHY
                 ----------------------------
                |                            |
                |                            v
        -----------------            -----------------
        | Declared code |            | Documentation |
        |    object     |            |    object     |
        -----------------            -----------------
                ^                            |
                |                            |
                 ----------------------------
                         .WHEREFORE
</pre><p>When the <a href="#How_Pod_is_parsed_and_processed">default <code>DOC INIT</code> block</a> renders these Pod objects, it automatically includes information about the declarator as well. For instance, the earlier Necrotelecomnicon example might produce something like:</p>
<samp>Name: Magic::Necrotelecomnicon:</br>Desc: Base class for comms necromancy hierarchy</br>Attrs:</br>.elemental : Source of all power</br>Methods:</br>.cast(Spell $s) : Initiate a specified spell normally</br>.kast(Spell $s) : Initiate a specified spell abnormally</br>Subroutines:</br>do_raw_magic( : This subroutine does the real work</br>Spell $s, : Which spell to invoke</br>*%options : How to invoke it</br>)</br></samp><p>Note, however, that the exact rendering used for declarator blocks is implementation dependent, and may also be pre-empted explicitly by some <a href="#How_Pod_is_parsed_and_processed"><code>DOC</code> configuration statement</a> within the document, such as:</p>
<pre>DOC use Pod::Markovian;</pre><p>or:</p>
<pre>    DOC INIT {
        use Pod::Eiffelish::Long;

        say eiffelish_long($=pod);

        exit;
    }
</pre><h3 id="Block_equivalence"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top document">Block equivalence</a></h3><p>The first three block specifications (delimited, paragraph, and abbreviated) are treated identically by the underlying documentation model, so you can use whichever form is most convenient for a particular documentation task. In the descriptions that follow, the abbreviated form will generally be used, but should be read as standing for all three forms equally.</p>
<p>For example, although <a href="#Headings">#Headings</a> shows only:</p>
<pre>     =head1 Top Level Heading
</pre><p>this automatically implies that you could also write that block as:</p>
<pre>     =for head1
     Top Level Heading
</pre><p>or:</p>
<pre>     =begin head1
     Top Level Heading
     =end head1
</pre><p>Declarator blocks are distinct from these three forms. They do not have typenames of their own, but rather take their meaning and identity from the declared object or type to which they are attached. In general, they are used specifically to describe that declarand.</p>
<h3 id="Standard_configuration_options"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top document">Standard configuration options</a></h3><p>Pod predefines a small number of standard configuration options that can be applied uniformly to any built-in block type. These include:</p>
<p><code>:nested</code></p>
<p>This option specifies that the block is to be nested within its current context. For example, nesting might be applied to block quotes, to textual examples, or to commentaries. In addition the <a href="#Code_blocks"><code>=code</code></a>, <a href="#Lists"><code>=item</code></a>, <a href="#I/O_blocks"><code>=input</code></a>, and <a href="#I/O_blocks"><code>=output</code></a> blocks all have implicit nesting.</p>
<p>Nesting of blocks is usually rendered by adding extra indentation to the block contents, but may also be indicated in other ways: by boxing the contents, by changing the font or size of the nested text, or even by folding the text (so long as a visible placeholder is provided).</p>
<p>Occasionally it is desirable to nest content by more than one level:</p>
<pre>    =begin para :nested
    =begin para :nested
    =begin para :nested
    &quot;We&#39;re going deep, deep, <em>deep</em> undercover!&quot;
    =end para
    =end para
    =end para
</pre><p>This can be simplified by giving the <code>:nested</code> option a positive integer value:</p>
<pre>    =begin para <strong>:nested(3)</strong>
    &quot;We&#39;re going deep, deep, <em>deep</em> undercover!&quot;
    =end para
</pre><p>You can also give the option a value of zero, to defeat any implicit nesting that might normally be applied to a paragraph. For example, to specify a block of code that should appear <em>without</em> its usual nesting:</p>
<pre>    =comment Don&#39;t nest this code block in the usual way...
    <strong>=begin code :nested(0)</strong>

                 1         2         3         4         5         6
        123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
        |------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
          line        instruction                comments
         number           code

    =end code
</pre><p>Note that <code>:!nested</code> could also be used for this purpose:</p>
<pre>    =begin code :!nested
</pre><p><code>:numbered</code></p>
<p>This option specifies that the block is to be numbered. The most common use of this option is to create <a href="#Numbered_headings">numbered headings</a> and <a href="#Ordered_lists">ordered lists</a>, but it can be applied to any block.</p>
<p>The numbering conventions for headings and lists are specified in those sections, but it is up to individual renderers to decide how to display any numbering associated with other types of blocks.</p>
<p>Note that numbering is never explicit; it is always implied by context.</p>
<p><code>:formatted</code></p>
<p>This option specifies that the contents of the block should be treated as if they had one or more <a href="#Formatting_codes">formatting codes</a> placed around them.</p>
<p>For example, instead of:</p>
<pre>    =for comment
        The next para is both important and fundamental,
        so doubly emphasize it...

    =begin para
    B&lt;I&lt;
    Warning: Do not immerse in water. Do not expose to bright light.
    Do not feed after midnight.
    &gt;&gt;
    =end para
</pre><p>you can just write:</p>
<pre>    =begin para <strong>:formatted&lt;B I&gt;</strong>
    Warning: Do not immerse in water. Do not expose to bright light.
    Do not feed after midnight.
    =end para
</pre><p>The internal representations of these two versions are exactly the same, except that the second one retains the <code>:formatted</code> option information as part of the resulting block object.</p>
<p>Like all formatting codes, codes applied via a <code>:formatted</code> are inherently cumulative. For example, if the block itself is already inside a formatting code, that formatting code will still apply, in addition to the extra "basis" and "important" formatting specified by <code>:formatted&lt;B I&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><code>:like</code></p>
<p>This option specifies that a block or config has the same formatting properties as the type named by its value. This is useful for creating related <a href="#Block_pre-configuration">configurations</a> or for making user-defined synonyms for existing types. For example:</p>
<pre>    =config head2  :like&lt;head1&gt; :formatted&lt;I&gt;

    =config Subhead :like&lt;head2&gt;
</pre><p><code>:allow</code></p>
<p>This option expects a list of formatting codes that are to be recognized within any <code>V&lt;&gt;</code> codes that appear in (or are implicitly applied to) the current block. The option is most often used on <code>=code</code> blocks to allow mark-up within those otherwise verbatim blocks, though it can be used in <em>any</em> block that contains verbatim text. See <a href="#Formatting_within_code_blocks">#Formatting within code blocks</a>.</p>
<p><code>:margin</code></p>
<p>This option specifies a character that indicates the left margin of the contents of the block. Normally this left margin is determined by the column at which the <code>=</code> of the opening block-delimiter occurs. For example:</p>
<pre>    =head1 Indenting Pod blocks

        =begin para
        This text is flush with the (virtual) left margin of
        the Pod block because that margin is implicitly specified
        by the C&lt;=&gt; of the C&lt;=begin&gt;
        =end para
</pre><p>However, by using the <code>:margin</code> option it is possible to specify a character that acts like an explicit margin when it occurs as the first non-whitespace character on any line within the block. For example:</p>
<pre>    =head1 Indenting Pod blocks

        =begin para :margin&lt;|&gt;
            |This text is flush with the (virtual) left margin of
            |the Pod block because that margin is explicitly marked
            |by the C&lt;|&gt;, as specified by the block&#39;s C&lt;:margin&lt;|&gt;&gt; option.
        =end para
</pre><p>The virtual margin can even be to the left of the opening delimiter, which can be convenient to guide subsequent indentations. For example:</p>
<pre>       sub foo {

           V&lt;=begin&gt; pod :margin&lt;|&gt;
           |=head1 Hey Look: Indented Pod!
           |
           |You can indent Pod in Perl 6
           |which makes code look cleaner
           |when documentation is interspersed

</pre><p>When a <code>:margin</code> option is used, each subsequent line (until the corresponding closing delimiter is encountered) simply has any text matching <code>/^^ \s* $margin_char/</code> automatically removed. This may include a line that then becomes the closing delimiter, as in the above example.</p>
<p>Any line from which such a margin marker is removed automatically resets the implicit margin for subsequent lines of the block, setting it to the length of the "marginalized" indent that was just removed. This implicit margin is then used until the next line with an explicit margin marker is encountered, or the block terminates.</p>
